# OffGridConstruction Mod

This mod allows to place buildings off-grid and also do fine rotation when holding shift, just like miners. It also allows to move and rotate the build grid to your liking

## How to use this mod

* Install the mod, and reboot the game.
* Now all buildings can be placed off-grid like Mining Machines

## Moving and Rotating the build grid

* The mod adds a new keybind "Control Build Grid", which defaults to Z
* While holding the keybind
    * Hover over a placed building to align the build grid with that building
    * Press the "Jump" keybind to toggle between polar and equator modes
    * When not hovering over a building
        * Press the "Build Mode" key to restore the grid to it's initial state (Defaults to B)
        * Hold the "Movement" keys to move the build grid (Defaults to WASD)
        * Hold the "Ignore Grid" key to move the grid to the cursor location (Defaults to Shift)
        * Hold the "Ignore Grid" + "Rotation" keys to rotate the build grid (Defaults to R and the arrow keys)
